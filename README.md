## Coder Factory Term 2 Project (Ruby on Rails)
# Junior Dev Jobs
### A site for both Coder Factory students and interested employers, to showcase their skills and find talented Junior developers, respectively.
## Live - http://jrdevjobs.herokuapp.com/

## Problem

As Coder Factory students have to have 1 month internship experiences in order to graduate from the course and employers used to visit different websites to look for the potential candidates among coder factory students. It would be time saving and convenient for employers to only visit one website where all the relevant informations from candidates will be listed and they can find the right candidates for their company.

## Solution

A services that will allow Coder Factory students to crate an profile and list all of their qualifications, experiences, skills, contact details with headshot and little about them. Their profile will have a summery of their github account so it will be easy for employers to drive into students recent or past projects if they are interested. 

Companies will also be able to create and account and post jobs if they think they want Coder Factory graduates to apply for any particular jobs or they can message any students if they think he or she will be best match for that position.
